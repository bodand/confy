## TokyoNight Color Scheme
# The followings are the TokyoNight color scheme's colors in confy format
#
## Value encoding
#
# The colors are encoded in hexadecimal without a leading prefix, this allows
# easier interop with things that require them prefixed differently:
# Xresources expects it in `#RRGGBB` format, while Alacritty in `0xRRGGBB`.
# Therefore we only store it as `RRGGBB` and do what you want with it.
#
## Key names
#
# Values are set with both Xresources style `colorXX` names, and human readable
# names. The colors and their alternatives are called `<color>1` and
# `<color>2`, e.g. `red1` and `red2`, corresponding to `color1` and `color9`
# respectively.
