/**
 * \file visitor.cpp
 * \brief The implementation source file for the visitor.hpp header file.
 *
 * This file provides the non-template functions' implementation from the visitor.hpp file. Since
 * most functions are templates, this file's most important purpose is to make sure the visitor.hpp
 * file doesn't accidentally rely on other headers being included before it--otherwise this file
 * which only includes it would fail to compile.
